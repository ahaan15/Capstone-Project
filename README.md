# Package Management System

This project is an attempt to remove the need to manually keep a note of the couriers in our package room at Bennett University and also reduce the time and energy spend by both admin and students to deliver/receive the package. We are building this app using flutter.

Note:
Before running the app, you will need to edit the file 'work1.dart' under the 'lib' folder and enter your email id and password in line 39-40.
